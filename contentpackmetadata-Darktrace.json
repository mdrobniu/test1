This ensures your endpoint data is accompanied by tailored Darktrace alerts on anomalous activities within your network, SaaS, cloud and industrial environments.\n\nTogether with XSOAR, this pack can speed up your triage workflow, boost SOC efficiency and ensure all your security coverage can be found in one place.\n\nWhat does this pack do?\n\nThis pack provides three optional sub-integrations by pulling a variety of Darktrace metrics:\n\n- Model Breaches and all model breach related actions (such as commenting, acknowledging and model logic info).\n- AI Analyst investigations indicative of critical incidents along with accompanying summaries and timelines. AI actions can also be applied.\n- Device administration data including device statuses and tags. Your understanding of potential threats can also be levelled-up with Advanced Search logs from DPI.\n\nCustomers can decide which of these alerts are integrated, ensuring visibility is bespoke to your individual SOC’s needs. Alerts from the connector will populate in the XSOAR ‘Incidents’ tab.\n",
